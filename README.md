# School Administration Example (Java Servlets)

#### This is a School Administration System I built for a school assignment a while ago. My first experience with Java coming from C++ and also my first introduction to Web App development.

## ðŸ“š Requirements/Things to Note

- #### GlassFish Server - If you don't have GlassFish installed, you will be promted to "`Resolve problems by insalling missing server`" or whatever. Just `Right-Click` on your `project` folder, and follow the Resolution Wizard by installing GlassFish. You don't need to worry about any further configuration beyond the installation, and any version of the Glassfish Embedded Server will do.
- #### Java Web API (7+) - This library will be required for the usage of the servlet features. So if you don't have the library added to your project:
  - ##### Right-Click on "`Libraries`"
  - ##### Select "`Add Library`"
  - ##### Select the "`Java Web API`" version available, preferably 8.

#### This is a `[Ant]` project, will change to `[Maven]`.
